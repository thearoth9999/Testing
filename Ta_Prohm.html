				<b>Ta Prohm</b> is the modern name of a temple at Angkor, <a href=Cambodia.html>Cambodia</a> , built in the Bayon style largely in the late 12th and early 13th centuries and originally called Rajavihara. Located approximately one kilometre east of <a href=Angkor_Wat.html>Angkor</a> Thom and on the southern edge of the East Baray near Tonle Bati, it was founded by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII as a Mahayana Buddhist monastery and university. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Ta Prohm has been left in much the same condition in which it was found: the photogenic and atmospheric combination of trees growing out of the ruins and the jungle surroundings have made it one of Angkor's most popular temples with visitors.

				After ascending the throne of Cambodia in 1181 A.D., Jayavarman VII embarked on a massive program of construction and public works. Rajavihara ("royal temple"), today known as Ta Prohm ("ancestor Brahma"), was one of the first temples founded pursuant to that program. The stele commemorating the foundation gives a date of 1186 A.D.[1]
				Jayavarman VII constructed Rajavihara in honor of his family. The temple's main image, representing Prajnaparamita, the personification of wisdom, was modelled on the king's mother. The northern and southern satellite temples in the third enclosure were dedicated to the king's guru and his elder brother respectively. As such, Ta Prohm formed a complementary pair with the temple monastery of Preah Khan, dedicated in 1191 A.D., the main image of which represented Lokesvara, the Bodhisattva of compassion, as modelled 
		on the king's father. The temple's stele records that the site was home 
		to more than 12,500 people (including 18 high priests and 615 dancers), 
		with an additional 80,000 souls in the surrounding villages working to 
		provide services and supplies. The stele also notes that the temple 
		amassed considerable riches, including gold, pearls and silks. Expansions and additions to Ta Prohm continued as late as the rule of Srindravarman at the end of the 13th century.
				After the fall of the Khmer empire in the 15th century, the temple of Ta Prohm was abandoned and neglected for centuries. When the effort to conserve and restore the temples of Angkor began in the early 20th century, the École française d'Extrême-Orient decided that Ta Prohm would be left largely as it had been found, as a "concession to the general taste for the picturesque." According to Maurice Glaize, Ta Prohm 
		was singled out because it was &quot;one of the most imposing [temples] and 
		the one which had best merged with the jungle, but not yet to the point 
		of becoming a part of it&quot;. Nevertheless, much work has been done to 
		stabilize the ruins, to permit access, and to maintain &quot;this condition 
		of apparent neglect.<p><b><u><font size=4>Layout</font></u></b>

				The design of Ta Prohm is that of a typical "flat" Khmer temple (as opposed to a temple-pyramid, the inner levels of which are higher than the outer). Five rectangular enclosing walls surround a central sanctuary. Like most Khmer temples, Ta Prohm is oriented to the east, so the temple proper is set back to the west along an elongated east-west axis. The outer wall of 1000 by 650 metres encloses an area of 650,000 square metres that at one time would have been the site of a substantial town, but that is now largely forested. There are entrance gopuras at each of the cardinal points, although access today is now only possible from the east and west. In the 13th century, face towers similar to those found at the Bayon were added to the gopuras. Some of the face towers have collapsed. At one time, moats could be found inside and outside the fourth enclosure.
				The three inner enclosures of the temple proper are galleried, while the corner towers of the first enclosure form a quincunx with the tower of the central sanctuary. This basic plan is complicated for the visitor by the circuitous access necessitated by the temple's partially collapsed state, as well as by the large number of other buildings dotting the site, some of which represent later additions. The most substantial of these other buildings are the libraries in the southeast corners of the first and third enclosures; the satellite temples on the north and south sides of the third enclosure; the Hall of Dancers between the third and fourth eastern gopuras; and a House of Fire east of the fourth eastern gopura.
			A bas-relief over an entrance at Ta Prohm includes this intense meditating or praying figure.
				Ta Prohm has few narrative bas-reliefs. One explanation that has been proffered for this dearth is that much of the temple's original Buddhist narrative artwork must have been destroyed by Hindu iconoclasts following the death of Jayavarman 
		VII. At any rate, some depictions of scenes from Buddhist mythology do 
		remain. One badly eroded bas-relief illustrates the &quot;Great Departure&quot; of 
		Siddhartha, the future Buddha, from his father's palace. The temple also features stone reliefs of devatas (minor female deities), meditating monks or ascetics, and Dvarapalas or temple guardians.
				The trees growing out of the ruins are perhaps the most distinctive feature of Ta Prohm, 
		and &quot;have prompted more writers to descriptive excess than any other 
		feature of Angkor. Two species predominate: the larger is the silk-cotton tree (Ceiba pentandra), and the smaller is the strangler fig (Ficus gibbosa). Indulging in what might be regarded as "descriptive excess," Angkor scholar Maurice Glaize 
		observed, &quot;On every side, in fantastic over-scale, the trunks of the 
		silk-cotton trees soar skywards under a shadowy green canopy, their long 
		spreading skirts trailing the ground and their endless roots coiling 
		more like reptiles than plants.
				The temple of Ta Prohm was used as a location in the film Tomb Raider. Although the film took visual liberties with other Angkorian temples, its scenes of Ta Prohm were quite faithful to the temple's actual appearance, and made use of its eerie qualities.
