			<font face="Times New Roman">The <b>Kingdom of Cambodia</b> (pronounced , formerly known as Kampuchea) is a country in Southeast Asia with a population of over 13 million people. <a href=Phnom_Penh.html>Phnom Penh</a> is the capital city. Cambodia is the successor state of the once powerful Hindu and Buddhist Khmer Empire, which ruled most of the Indochinese Peninsula between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries. From: Gabi IngersollItalic text
			A citizen of Cambodia is usually identified as "Cambodian" or "Khmer," though the latter strictly refers to ethnic Khmers. Most Cambodians are Theravada Buddhists of Khmer extraction, but the country also has a substantial number of predominantly Muslim Cham, as well as ethnic Chinese, Vietnamese and small animist hill tribes.
			The country borders Thailand to its west and northwest, Laos to its northeast, and Vietnam to its east and southeast. In the south it faces the Gulf of Thailand. The geography of Cambodia is dominated by the Mekong river (colloquial Khmer: Tonle Thom or "the great river") and the Tonlé Sap ("the fresh water lake"), an important source of fish. Much of Cambodia sits near sea level, and consequently the Tonle Sap River reverses its water flow in the wet season, carrying water from the Mekong back into the Tonlé 
			Sap Lake and surrounding flood plain. Cambodia's main industries are 
			garments and tourism. In 2006, foreign visitors had surpassed the 1.7 
			million mark. In 2005, oil and natural gas deposits were found beneath 
			Cambodia's territorial water, and once commercial extraction begins in 
			2009 or early 2010, the oil revenues could profoundly affect Cambodia's economy.

			Cambodia is the traditional English transliteration, taken from the French Cambodge, while Kampuchea is the direct transliteration, more faithful to the Khmer pronunciation. The Khmer Kampuchea is derived from the ancient Khmer kingdom of Kambuja (Kambujadesa). Kambuja or Kamboja is the ancient Sanskrit name of the Kambojas, an early tribe of north India, named after their founder Kambu Svayambhuva, believed to be a variant of Cambyses. See Etymology of Kamboja

			Main article: Early history of Cambodia
			Prehistoric Cambodia is poorly known, as a large part of modern-day Cambodia was under water 6000 years ago. Evidence of cave dwellers has been found in northwest Cambodia and carbon dating of ceramic pots found in the area shows that they were made around 4200 BC. However, historians find it difficult to directly relate these with the modern Khmer.
			Archaeologists discovered that in 1000 BC the peoples lived in houses on stilts and subsisted on a diet of fish and cultivated rice. Archaeological evidence indicates that parts of the region now called Cambodia were inhabited during the first and second millennia BCE by a Neolithic culture that may have migrated from South Eastern China to the Indochinese Peninsula. By the first century CE, the inhabitants had developed relatively stable, organized societies which had far surpassed the primitive stage in culture and technical skills. The most advanced groups lived along the coast and in the lower Mekong River valley and delta regions where they cultivated rice and kept domesticated animals. Recent research has unlocked the discovery of artificial circular earthworks dating to Cambodia's Neolithic era.1
			The Khmer people were one of the first inhabitants of South East Asia. They were also among the first in South East Asia to adopt religious ideas and political institutions from India and to establish centralized kingdoms encompassing large territories. The earliest known kingdom in the area, Funan, flourished from around the first to the sixth century AD. This was succeeded by Chenla, which controlled large parts of modern Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand..

			The golden age of Khmer civilization, however, was the period from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries, when the kingdom of Kambuja, which gave Kampuchea, or Cambodia, its name, ruled large territories from its capital in the region of Angkor in western Cambodia.
			Under Jayavarman VII (1181-ca. 1218), Kambuja reached its zenith of political power and cultural creativity. Jayavarman VII gained power and territory in a series of successful wars against its close enemies; the Cham and the Vietnamese. Following Jayavarman VII's death, Kambuja experienced a gradual decline. Important factors were the aggressiveness of neighboring peoples (especially the Thai, or Siamese), chronic interdynastic strife, and the gradual deterioration of the complex irrigation system that had ensured rice surpluses. The Angkorian monarchy survived until 1431, when the Thai captured Angkor Thom and the Cambodian king fled to the southern part of the country.

			Cambodia during the dark ages The fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries were a period of continued decline and territorial loss. Cambodia enjoyed a brief period of prosperity during the sixteenth century because its kings, who built their capitals in the region southeast of the Tonle Sap along the Mekong River, promoted trade with other parts of Asia. This was the period when Spanish and Portuguese adventurers and missionaries first visited the country. But the Thai conquest of the new capital at Lovek in 1594 marked a downturn in the country's fortunes and Cambodia became a pawn in power struggles between its two increasingly powerful neighbors, Siam and Vietnam. Vietnam's settlement of the <a href=Mekong.html>Mekong</a> Delta led to its annexation of that area at the end of the seventeenth century. Cambodia thereby lost some of its richest territory and was cut off from the sea. Such foreign encroachments continued through the first half of the nineteenth century because Vietnam was determined to absorb Khmer land and to force the inhabitants to accept Vietnamese culture.
			Main article: Colonial Cambodia
			In 1863, King Norodom signed an agreement with the French to establish a protectorate over his kingdom. The state gradually came under French colonial domination. During World War II, the Japanese allowed the French government (based at Vichy) that collaborated with therepublican opponents and attempted to negotiate acceptable terms for independence from the French. Sihanouk's "royal crusade for independence" resulted in grudging French acquiescence to his demands for a transfer of sovereignty. A partial agreement was struck in October 1953. Sihanouk then declared that independence had been achieved and returned in triumph to Phnom Penh.

			In 1863 King Norodom, who had been installed by Thailand, sought the protection of France. In 1867, the Thai king signed a treaty with France, renouncing Suzerainty over Cambodia in exchange for the control of Battambang and Siem Reap provinces which officially became part of Thailand. The provinces were ceded back to Cambodia by a border treaty between France and Thailand in 1906.
			Cambodia continued as a protectorate of France from 1863 to 1953, administered as part of the French colony of Indochina. After war-time occupation by the Japanese empire from 1941 to 1945, Cambodia gained independence from France on November 9, 1953. It became a constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk.
			In 1955, Sihanouk abdicated in favour of his father in order to be elected Prime Minister. Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of Prince. As the Vietnam War progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of neutrality until ousted in 1970 by a military coup led by Prime Minister General Lon Nol and Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, while on a trip abroad. From Beijing, Sihanouk realigned himself with the communist Khmer Rouge rebels who had been slowly gaining territory in the remote mountain regions and urged his followers to help in overthowing the pro-United States government of Lon Nol, 
		hastening the onset of civil war.
			Operation Menu, a series of secret B-52 bombing raids by the United States on alleged Viet Cong bases and supply routes inside Cambodia, was acknowledged after Lon Nol 
		assumed power; U.S. forces briefly invaded Cambodia in a further effort 
		to disrupt the Viet Cong. The bombing continued and, as the Cambodian 
		communists began gaining ground, eventually included strikes on 
		suspected Khmer Rouge sites until halted in 1973.
			Some two million Cambodians were made refugees by the bombing and fighting and fled to Phnom Penh. Estimates of the number of Cambodians killed during the bombing campaigns vary widely. Views of the effects of the bombing also vary widely. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.[8]Journalist William Shawcross and Cambodia specialists Milton Osborne, David Chandler and Ben Kiernan argued that the bombing drove peasants to join the Khmer Rouge. Chandler writes that the bombing provided "the psychological ingredients of a violent, vengeful and unrelenting social revolution.Cambodia specialist Craig Etcheson 
		argued that it is &quot;untenable&quot; to assert that the Khmer Rouge would not 
		have won but for US intervention, and that while the bombing did help 
		Khmer Rouge recruitment, they &quot;would have won anyway.<p align=justify>

		As the war ended, a draft US AID report observed that the country faced 
		famine in 1975, with 75% of its draft animals destroyed by the war, and 
		that rice planting for the next harvest would have to be done &quot;by the 
		hard labor of seriously malnourished people.&quot; The report predicted that 
		without large-scale external food and equipment assistance there will be 
		widespread starvation between now and next February... Slave labor and 
		starvation rations for half the nation's people (probably heaviest among 
		those who supported the republic) will be a cruel necessity for this 
		year, and general deprivation and suffering will stretch over the next 
		two or three years before Cambodia can get back to rice 
		self-sufficiency. Pol Pot in 1975 The Khmer Rouge reached Phnom Penh and took power in 1975, changing the official name of the country to Democratic Kampuchea, led by Pol 
		Pot. They immediately evacuated the cities and sent the entire 
		population on forced marches to rural work projects. They attempted to 
		rebuild the country's agriculture on the model of the 11th century. They 
		also discarded Western medicine, with the result that while hundreds of 
		thousands died from starvation and disease there were almost no drugs in 
		the country.
			Estimates vary as to how many people were killed by the Khmer Rouge regime. Father Francois Ponchaud, 
		author of Cambodia: Year Zero suggested 2 million.&nbsp; United Nations 
		investigators estimated 2-3 million.&nbsp; The Vietnamese-backed People's Republic of Kampuchea government carried out a house-to-house survey and reported 3 million dead. Kimmo Kiljunen's 
		&quot;Finnish Inquiry Commission&quot; estimated 1 million dead, including 
		75-100,000 from executions.&nbsp;

			The politics of Cambodia formally take place, according to the nation's constitution of 1993, in the framework of a parliamentary, representative democratic monarchy. The Prime Minister of Cambodia is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system, while the king is the head of state. The Prime Minister is appointed by the King, on the advice and with the approval of the National Assembly; the Prime Minister and his or her ministerial appointees exercise executive power in government. Legislative power is vested in both the executive and the two chambers of parliament, the National Assembly of Cambodia and the Senate.
			On October 14, 2004, King Norodom Sihamoni was selected by a special nine-member throne council, part of a selection process that was quickly put in place after the surprise abdication of King Norodom Sihanouk a week before. Sihamoni's selection was endorsed by Prime Minister Hun Sen and National Assembly Speaker Prince Norodom Ranariddh (the new king's brother), both members of the throne council. He was crowned in Phnom Penh on October 29. The monarchy is symbolic and does not exercise political power. Norodom Sihamoni was trained in Cambodian classical dance. Due to his long stay in the Czech Republic (then part of Czechoslovakia) Norodom Sihamoni 
		is fluent in the Czech language. In 2006, Transparency International's 
		rating of corrupt countries rated Cambodia as 151 of 163 countries of 
		their Corruption Perceptions Index.. The 2007 edition of the same list 
		placed Cambodia at 162nd out of 179 countries . According to this same 
		list, Cambodia is the 3rd most corrupt nation in the South-East Asia 
		area, behind Laos, at 168th, and Myanmar, at joint 179th. The BBC 
		reports that corruption is rampant in the Cambodian political arena with 
		international aid from the U.S. and other countries being illegally 
		transferred into private accounts.Corruption has also added to the wide 
		income disparity within the population.
