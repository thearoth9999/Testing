			<b>Kampot</b> has been the administrative center for southern <a href=Cambodia.html>Cambodia</a> for hundreds of years and is home to a striking collection of colonial 
			architecture - much of the movie City of Ghosts was filmed here. Especially the area around the Old Market, along the Riverside Road with 
			the Governor's mansion and prison in the backstreets are worth a look. The characteristic 'Old Bridge' shows the wear and tear it has had to endure. 
			The new bridge just to the north was inaugurated by Prime Minister Hun Sen in May 2007.
			Kampot Sights & Activities By no means can the crumbling old buildings at Bokor Mountain Hill Station compete with the grandeur of Angkor Wat, but this charming coastal town and stunning surroundings offer a look into Cambodia's more recent history:the one under the French rule from 1864 to 1953. 
    		The wide river, mountains, lush nature and friendly people make this an ideal place for true relaxation.  
    		It is well worth renting a bicycle or a motorbike for a day or two. It gives you the opportunity to peek into rural Cambodian life set amidst acres and acres of rice fields and pepper and fruit plantations. Main roads are most often well paved and have little traffic, roads into villages and further afield are generally dirt tracks.  
		<p><b><u><font size=4> Bokor Hill Station</font></u></b>
		<p align=justify>
			Set in Preah Monivong National Park, at 37km from Kampot, partially via a poorly maintained road, you find Bokor Hill Station. Bokor Hill Station is a mountaintop collection of buildings (hotel, casino, church, royal residence, etc.), constructed by French authorities in the early 1920s as a complement to the already popular Kep resort area. In the 1990s, a travel author referred to Bokor as ‘the eeriest place in the world’, and it lives up to that reputation. 
			In its time, Bokor was an elegant getaway for French officials and foreign visitors to old Indochina - a classic colonial ‘hill station’ located in the mountains to allow visitors accustomed to more temperate climates to escape the tropical heat. But years of neglect have left ghostly ruins - vestiges of a different age, often shrouded in fog and clouds. One thing that the years have not changed is the absolutely spectacular view of the coast and the cool (sometimes cold) mountain air. Wild elephants and other jungle animals are occasionally seen.
			There is a $5.00 entrance fee to Preah Monivong NP, valid for one entry. 
			There is a small guesthouse on top with $5 rooms, good toilets and very few other services. If you are going to stay on Bokor, take food as the guesthouse has little to offer. 
			For adventurers, it is possible to rent 250cc dirtbikes for about $10.00 per day. Take Route #3 from Kampot to <a href=Sihanouk.html>Sihanoukville</a> to the well-marked turnoff. The ranger station is about a kilometer up the road. Badly broken pavement all the way up the mountain. For experienced riders, it’s a moderate dirt bike ride. It is painful but possible on a small 100cc bike. Bring warm clothes and enough petrol.
			Local tour operator Sok Lim Tours offer a good value for money 1 day combination tour of Bokor, Tek Chhou Rapids and a sunset river cruise.

			The sun sets behind the Elephant Mountains, and sunset river cruises are offered to view this often colourful spectacle. The ride from Kampot to the rapids at Tek Chou and back is most popular. Private boats are for rent at $10.00 per hour.
			A picnic area on the Prek Chha river, about 8 km from Kampot town on a well paved road. Popular with the locals, especially on weekends. Some food and drink stalls. The rapids and river breeze make a pleasant cool down on a hot summer's afternoon.
			Limestone mountains (‘phnom’) dot the landscape between Kampot and <a href=kep.html>Kep</a> . Many contain limestone caves, some adorned with exotic rock formations, and almost all containing Buddhist shines. Make sure to bring a torch and wear shoes suitable for climbing on rocks. 
			The caves of Phnom Chhnork Cave #1 Pre-<a href=Angkor_Wat.html>Angkorian</a> ruin set in a limestone cave amongst stalagmites and stalactites that are slowly growing back into the ruin. Small, 4th-5th century AD brick structure associated with the ancient state of Funan. A bit of carving is still visible. Look for the limestone formations near the entrance of the cave in the shapes of elephants. 
			Cave #2 The entrance is about 300 meters from Cave #1 in the same limestone outcropping. Very little in the way of formations, but quite deep, requiring climbing over piles of rock and through small openings. Small shrine. 
			Phnom K’Chnor Pre-Angkorian ruin set in a limestone cave amongst stalagmites and stalactites that are slowly growing into the ruin. Small, 4th-5th century AD brick structure associated with the ancient state of Funan. A bit of carving is still visible.
			The cave at Phnom Sasear, also known as the ‘White Elephant Cave.’ Located next to an colorful pagoda. The stairs up the side of the outcropping provide a beautiful view of the countryside, especially during the wet season. The cave contains a shrine at the base of a limestone formation alleged to resemble a white elephant. 
			Sok Lim Tours organises an interesting 1 day trip to the caves, salt fields, pepper plantations, Kep and Rabbit Island.
