		Angkor Wat (or Angkor Vat) is a temple at Angkor, <a href=Cambodia.html>Cambodia</a> , built for King Suryavarman II in the early 12th century as his state temple and capital city. Also the best-preserved temple at the site, 
		it is the only one to have remained a significant religious centre since its foundation—first Hindu, dedicated to Vishnu, then Buddhist. The temple is the epitome of the high classical style of Khmer 
		architecture. It has become a symbol of Cambodia, appearing on its national flag, and it is the country's prime attraction for visitors.
		Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture: the temple mountain and the later galleried temples. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of the gods in Hindu mythology: within 
		a moat and an outer wall 3.6 km (2.2 miles) long are three rectangular galleries, each raised above the next. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Unlike most Angkorian temples, Angkor 
		Wat is oriented to the west; scholars are divided as to the significance of this. The temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture, its extensive bas-reliefs and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls.
		<p align=justify>
		Angkor Wat is the southernmost temple of Angkor's main group of sites.
		The initial design and construction of the temple took place in the first half of the 12th century, during the reign of Suryavarman II (ruled 1113–c. 1150), Dedicated to Vishnu, it was built as the king's state temple and capital city. As neither the foundation stela nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found, its original name is unknown, but it may have been known as Vrah Vishnulok after the presiding deity. The structure is located 5.5 km north of the modern town of Siem Reap, and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred on the Baphuon. Work seems to have ended on the king's death, with some of the bas-reliefs unfinished. In 1177 Angkor was sacked by the Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter the empire was restored by a new king, Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital and state temple (Angkor Thom and the Bayon respectively) a few kilometres to the north.

		Angkor Wat is the southernmost temple of Angkor's main group of sites.

The structure is located 5.5 km north of the modern town of <a href=Siem_Reap.html>Siem Reap</a>, and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred on the Baphuon. Work seems to have ended on the king's death, with some of the bas-reliefs unfinished.[1] In 1177 Angkor was sacked by the Chams, the traditional enemies of the Khmer. Thereafter the empire was restored by a new king, Jayavarman VII, who established a new capital and state temple (Angkor Thom and the <a href=Bayon.html>Bayon</a> respectively) a few kilometres to the north.
		In the 14th or 15th century the temple was converted to Theravada Buddhist use, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat 
		is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat 
		neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned. Its 
		moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle. Around this time the temple was known as Preah Pisnulok, after the posthumous title of Suryavarman. 
		The modern name, in use by the 16th century, means "City Temple": Angkor is a vernacular form of the word nokor which comes from the Sanskrit word nagara (capital), while wat is the Khmer word for temple.
		One of the first Western visitors to the temple was Antonio da Magdalena, a Portuguese monk who visited in 1586 and said that it "is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen, particularly since it is like no other building in the world. 
		It has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human 
		genius can conceive of&quot;. However, the temple was n the mid-19th century on the publication of Henri Mouhot's travel notes. The French explorer wrote of it:
		One of these temples—a rival to that of Solomon, and erected by some ancient Michelangelo—might take an honourable 
		place beside our most beautiful buildings. It is grander than anything 
		left to us by Greece or Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state 
		of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged.<p align=justify>
		Mouhot, like other early Western visitors, was unable to believe that the Khmers could have built the temple, and mistakenly dated it to around the same era as Rome. The true history of Angkor Wat was pieced together only from stylistic and epigraphic evidence accumulated during the subsequent clearing and restoration work carried out across the whole Angkor site.
		Angkor Wat required considerable restoration in the 20th century, mainly 
		the removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the civil war and Khmer Rouge control of the country during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period other than the theft and destruction of mostly post-Angkorian 
		statues.
		The temple has become a symbol of Cambodia, and is a source of great national pride. A depiction of Angkor Wat 
		has been a part of every Cambodian national flag since the introduction 
		of the first version circa 1863—the only building to appear on any 
		national flag. In January 2003 riots erupted in Phnom Penh when a false rumour circulated that a Thai soap opera actress had claimed that Angkor Wat 
		belonged to Thailand .</p>

	<p align=justify><br><img src=images/200px-Angkor-wat-central.jpg align=left>
		Angkor Wat, located at 13°24&#8242;45&#8243;N, 103°52&#8242;0&#8243;ECoordinates: 13°24&#8242;45&#8243;N, 103°52&#8242;0&#8243;E, is a unique combination of the temple mountain, the standard design for the empire's state temples, the later plan of concentric galleries, and influences from Orissa and the Chola of Tamil Nadu, India. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, the home of the gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises 
	the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat the surrounding 
	mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was 
	progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the 
	lowest level.
		Unlike most Khmer temples, Angkor Wat is oriented to the west rather than the east. This has led many (including Glaize and George Coedès) to conclude that Suryavarman 
	intended it to serve as his funerary temple. Further evidence for this view is provided by the bas-reliefs, which proceed in a counter-clockwise direction—prasavya in Hindu terminology—as this is the reverse of the normal order. Rituals take place in reverse order during Brahminic 
	funeral services. The archaeologist Charles Higham also describes a 
	container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the 
	central tower. Freeman and Jacques, however, note that several other temples of Angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation, and suggest that Angkor Wat's 
	alignment was due to its dedication to Vishnu, who was associated with the 
	west.
		A further interpretation of Angkor Wat has been proposed by Eleanor Mannikka. Drawing on the temple's alignment and dimensions, and on the content and arrangement of the bas-reliefs, she argues that these indicate a claimed new era of peace under king Suryavarman II: "as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of Angkor Wat, 
	this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and 
	corridors meant to perpetuate the king's power and to honor and placate the 
	deities manifest in the heavens above.&quot; Mannikka's suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism 
	in academic circles. She distances herself from the speculations of others, such as Graham Hancock, that Angkor Wat is part of a representation of the constellation Draco.

		The outer wall, 1025 by 802 m and 4.5 m high, is surrounded by a 30 m apron of open ground and a moat 190 m wide. Access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west; the latter, the main entrance, is a later addition, possibly replacing a wooden bridge. There are gopuras at each of the cardinal points; the western is much the largest and has three ruined towers. Glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper. Under the southern tower is a statue of Vishnu, known as Ta Reach, which may originally have occupied the temple's central shrine. Galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as "elephant gates", as they are large enough to admit those animals. These galleries have square pillars on the outer (west) side and a closed wall on the inner (east) side. The ceiling between the pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes; the west face of the wall with dancing figures; and the east face of the wall with balustered windows, dancing male figures on prancing animals, and devatas, including (south of the entrance) the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth.
		The outer wall encloses a space of 820,000 square metres (203 acres), 
	which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and, to 
	the north of the temple, the royal palace. Like all secular buildings of 
	Angkor, these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone, so 
	nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets. Most of the area is now covered by forest. A 350 m causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper, with naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side. Each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal point, in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance, and a pond between the library and the temple itself. The ponds are later additions to the design, as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure.

	<b><u><font size=5>Outer enclosure</font></u></b>
	<p align=justify><img src=images/250px-Steps-ankor.jpg align=left>
		On the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes, the Churning of the Sea of Milk, showing 92 asuras and 88 devas using the serpent Vasuki to churn the sea under Vishnu's direction (Mannikka counts only 91 asuras, and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the winter solstice to the spring equinox, and from the equinox to the summer solstice). It is followed by Vishnu defeating asuras (a 16th-century addition). The northern gallery shows Krishna's victory over Bana (where according to Glaize, "The workmanship is at its worst") and a battle between the Hindu gods and asuras. The north-west and south-west corner pavilions both feature much smaller-scale scenes, some unidentified but most from the Ramayana or the life of Krishna.
		Connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called Preah Poan (the "Hall of a Thousand Buddhas&quot;). 
	Buddha images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries, 
	although most have now been removed. This area has many inscriptions 
	relating the good deeds of pilgrims, most written in Khmer but others in 
	Burmese and Japanese. The four small courtyards marked out by the cloister 
	may originally have been filled with water. North and south of the cloister are libraries.
	</p>
	
	<p align=justify><img src=images/200px-Dsc04092.jpg align=left>
		Since the 1990s, Angkor Wat has seen a resumption of conservation 
	efforts and a massive increase in tourism. The temple is part of the Angkor 
	World Heritage Site, established in 1992, which has provided some funding 
	and has encouraged the Cambodian government to protect the site. The German Apsara Conservation Project (GACP) is working to protect the devatas and other bas-reliefs which decorate the temple from damage. The organisation's survey found that around 20% of the devatas 
	were in very poor condition, mainly because of natural erosion and 
	deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration 
	efforts. Other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the 
	structure, and prevention of further collapse: the west facade of the upper 
	level, for example, has been buttressed by scaffolding since 2002, while a Japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in 2005.
		Angkor Wat has become a major tourist destination: attendance figures for the temple are not published, but in 2004 the country received just over a million international arrivals, of whom according to the Ministry of Tourism 57% planned to visit the temple. The influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage, other than some graffiti; ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas-reliefs and floors, respectively. Tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance—approximately 28% of ticket revenues across the whole Angkor site is spent on the temples—although most work is carried out by foreign government-sponsored teams rather than by the Cambodian authorities.
