			The Bayon is a well-known and richly decorated Khmer temple at Angkor in <a href=Cambodia.html>Cambodia</a> . Built in the late 12th century or early 13th century as the official state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII, 
			the Bayon stands at the centre of Jayavarman's capital, Angkor Thom. Following Jayavarman's death, it was modified and augmented by later Hindu and Theravada Buddhist kings in accordance with their own religious 
			preferences. The Bayon's most distinctive feature is the multitude 
			of serene and massive stone faces on the many towers which jut out 
			from the upper terrace and cluster around its central peak. The temple is known
 			also for two impressive sets of bas-reliefs, which present an unusual combination of mythological, historical, and mundane scenes. 
			The main current conservatory body, the JSA, has described the temple as "the most striking expression of the 'baroque' style" of Khmer architecture, as contrasted with the 'classical' style of <a href=Angkor_Wat.html>Angkor Wat</a> .
		<h3><u>History </h3></u></p>
		<img src="images\180px-JayavarmanVII.jpg" align=left hspace=5 vspace=5> </img>
		<p align=justify>
			King Jayavarman VII, identified with the bodhisattva Lokesvara, smiles down upon his subjects from one of the face towers of the Bayon.
			The Bayon was the last state temple to be built at Angkor, and the only one to be built primarily as a Mahayana Buddhist temple dedicated to the Buddha, though a great number of minor and local deities were also encompassed
 			as representatives of the various districts and cities of the realm. It was the centrepiece of Jayavarman VII's massive program of monumental construction and public works, which was also respsonsible for the walls and naga-bridges 
			of Angkor Thom and the temples of Preah Khan, Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei.
			The similarity of the 200 or so gigantic faces on the temple's towers to other statues of the king has led many scholars to the conclusion that the faces are representations of Jayavarman VII himself. Others have said that the faces 
			belong to the bodhisattva of compassion called Avalokitesvara or Lokesvara. The two hypotheses need not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Angkor scholar George Coedès has theorized that Jayavarman stood squarely in the tradition of 
			the Khmer monarchs in thinking of himself as a "devaraja" (god-king), the salient difference being that while his predecessors were Hindus and regarded themselves as consubstantial with Shiva and his symbol the lingam, Jayavarman as a 
			Buddhist identified himself with the Buddha and the bodhisattva.
			In the first part of the 20th century, the Ecole Française d'Extrême-Orient took the lead in the conservation of the temple, restoring it in accordance with the technique of anastylosis. Since 1995 the Japanese Government team for the 
			Safeguarding of Angkor (the JSA) has been the main conservatory body, and has held annual symposia.
			The temple is orientated towards the east, and so its buildings are set back to the west inside enclosures elongated along the east-west axis. Because the temple sits at the exact centre of Angkor Thom, roads lead to it directly from the 
			gates at each of the city's cardinal points. The temple itself has no wall or moats, these being replaced by those of the city itself: the city-temple arrangement, with an area of 9 square kilometres, is much larger than that of Angkor Wat 
			to the south . Within the temple itself, there are two galleried enclosures (the third and second enclosures) and an upper terrace (the first enclosure). All of these elements are crowded against each other with little space between. 
			Unlike Angkor Wat, which impresses with the grand scale
	        	of its architecture and open spaces, the Bayon "gives the impression of being compressed within a frame which is too tight for it."
